# Active Context: YouTube Summarizer (`yt-summaries`)

## Current work focus
The current focus is on improving the robustness and error handling of the core application.

## Recent changes
-   Added detailed error logging to the Gemini API call in `core.py`. If the API call fails, the full response will be printed to the console for easier debugging.
-   Modified the `getSummaries` Firebase function to sort the results by upload date in descending order.
-   Created a Firebase function `getSummaries` to list all video metadata.
-   Created a Firebase function `getVideo` to get the metadata and summary for a single video.
-   Created a web page (`index.html`) to display the list of videos.
-   Created a web page (`video.html`) to display the details of a single video.
-   Made the video blocks on the main page clickable, linking to the video details page.
-   Added a hover effect to the video blocks to improve user experience.
-   Configured Firebase Hosting to serve the web pages.

## Next steps
-   Deploy the web interface to Firebase Hosting.
-   Verify that the web interface is working correctly.
-   Update the memory bank to reflect all the new changes.

## Active decisions and considerations
-   The user will handle Firebase project setup and API key configuration.
-   The user will manage the Python virtual environment and dependency installation.
-   Prioritizing robust core functionality and modularity for future extensions.

## Learnings and project insights
-   The importance of clear storage abstraction for future extensibility.
-   The benefits of separating concerns (e.g., HTML generation from storage).
-   Careful handling of `yt-dlp` output templates to avoid file naming issues.
-   The need for comprehensive documentation (README and Memory Bank) for complex projects.
